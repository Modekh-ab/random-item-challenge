## 🚰 [SpiggotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/random-item-challenge-by-bbh.105633/)

## 🌃 Abstract

- Native & tested **Minecraft version**: `1.19`
- This mod is a modified version of popular Random Item Challenge (or just RIC)
- Some disadvantages have been eliminated, and several possibilities have been added (such as providing almost all Minecraft items)

## 💭 Commands

- `/ric on` - challenge start
- `/ric off` - challenge stop

## 🗝 Config

- `"giving-item-stacks-amount"` - you can set amount of giving item stacks!
- `"take-floor-drop"` - want to take a dropped item? No problem!
- `"food-level-decreases"` - too easy? This should complicate the challenge - your food level is not infinity now (ю_ю)
- `"items"` - almost all Minecraft items there
